# Arduino ESP8266 sketch

The ESP Linoi board is a bit smaller than the regular arduinos that I have and since it's on hand I'll use whatever I can find that is compact enough to go into a small heatproof box.

The ESP carrier boards rather confusingly also have a pinout designation print on the board that uses a short form

This is the wiring for the MAX6675 SPI port and the RS485 converter

The transmitter enable is active high on this converter, and tied to transmitter enable which is active HIGH, a bit confusing, because I wnated the reciever to listen all the time and see reflections of every character sent out.
The PI end of the converter was tested using a 3V3 FTDI, and i just tied the enable line LOW so it's permanently listening. THat saves us a GPIO pin on the pi since we never send anything out.
