# Serial
Ran into distance issue and so have to now add serial comms to hook a thermoucouple MAX6675 in to the Raspberry pi over serial

The thermocouple will connect to a ESP8266, and send the readings over RS485 to the pi

Windows tools that are handy for some debugging are:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/

Loads of notes will be missing here, mainly because this is an area I know pretty well, so anything i omit, just shout and i can fill in all the implcit bits.
